# LambdaPiPlus: Learn and Hack Dependent Types

LambdaPiPlus is a small, dependently typed programming language
intended for research purposes.

The language has a small set of features, and a relatively simple code-base, which makes it
ideal for students learning to use dependent types,
as well as for researchers looking for a language in which to test new features.
